The following terms are used in these questions:

BNT - Biopharma Nucleotide Technology organization. Refers to either Moderna or BioNTech or any future potential partner organization actually engaged in large scale mRNA vaccine manufacture that could assist in establishing an industry in Victoria by acting as the Sending Unit (SU) supplying Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for a transfer of technology to some Australian Receiving Unit (RU). Curevac could be another possibility and there may be others.  Some BNT is assumed to be understood as an essential requirement for success. The specific acronym BNT is intentionally redolant of BioNTech as a reminder of the author's prejudices.

BioNTech - refers to the BNT that established an alliance between BioNTech and Fosum for China and between BioNTech and Pfizer for the rest of the world. It is generally referred to as "Pfizer" in Australia, but formal agreements with Pfizer could be the outcome of contacts with BioNTech leaders in Germany.

DISER - the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources

you - refers both to mRNA Victoria as an organization and to each member of staff or of the advisory group(s) as individuals.

Q1 DISER intends to make proposals to Cabinet for establishing an onshore mRNA vaccine manufacturing capability in Australia based on the advice of an offshore consulting firm and a secret panel of experts concerning detailed cost estimates solicited from Australian manufacturers for implementing a secret business case provided to DISER by the same offshore consultantcy but not provided to the manufacturers asked to cost and implement it. Replies are due in a week.

Are you confident that this process will produce good results? If so, why?

Q2 What preparations have you made for the possibility, however slight, that the DISER process might fail to produce good results?

Q3 If not you, who? If not now, when? Have you recruited engineers to examine the technical documents supporting any DISER results? Do you have lawyers on retainer ready to insist on performance of due diligence reviews? Has drafting begun on a request for audit by the Commonwealth Auditor-General? Has the State government been briefed on the possibility that political intervention may become necessary both between governments and via the Senate?

Q4 Australia's Government is running a vaccination campaign with the slogan:

"We're not safe until we're _all_ safe"

Find out when it's your turn and where you can be vaccinated at australia.gov.au

COVID-19
VACCINATION

KEEPING AUSTRALIA COVID**SAFE**

This directly undermines the global campaign from W.H.O.:

"No one is safe until everyone is safe"

The Australian government campaign explicitly replaces "everyone" with "we" and explicitly defines "we" as "Australia".

Do you agree that the DISER "Approach to Market" is based on the same "vaccine nationalist" premise?

Q5 Do you agree that Australians will become safe from covid-19 as a result of vaccination despite an ongoing pandemic with Variants of Concern continuing to emerge from uncontrolled community transmission in most of the world which remains unvaccinated?

Q6 If the supply chain "club" of some BNT is willing to pander to such vaccine nationalism by entering into negotiations with demands to be "at the head of the queue" from an Australian government for an "Australia first" facility at "population scale" should Australians be confident about joining a club that would accept such a member?

Q7 If some other BNT declines to enter into negotiations with Australia but establishes agreements for state of the art manufacturing facilities in Singapore for 2023 and a billion dose facility in China for the current pandemic, should we consider this means there is no alternative to Moderna? Or should we consider that we need to do whatever it takes to establish a CDMO that either or any BNT could plausibly work with?

Q8 The initial Fill and Finish plant in Shanghai is expected to produce its first BioNTech batch next month. CEPI has modular fillers that can be installed in developing countries in three months. The manufacturer, MedInstall can assemble one in warehouse space in 3 days (see video). BioNTech's CEO believes it will take 12 months to establish a Fill and Finish plant in Africa. Could we establish contact with CEPI, MedInstall, Imperial College VaxHub, Moderna, BioNTech, AstraZeneca and CSL to help install one here and one in South Africa very rapidly and organize clinical trials for TGA/EMA/FDA to accept 200 dose pouches as alternative presentations for the Final Dose Form of all three vaccines?

Q9 Have you read the Prime Minister's announcement dated 16 November 2020 of the $1 billion provided to CSL to upgrade its 1940s egg products to 1980s cell based vaccine technology?

Please do, or read it again and think about the implications.

Q10 According to CSL's Managing Director, Paul Perreault:

“This is not for the faint of heart. These are difficult biologics, and I think it’s a great opportunity for the future and we’ll continue to look at what role we’ll be able to play there. But it’s not going to happen overnight.”

https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/not-for-the-faint-of-heart-csl-interested-in-mrna-development-20210221-p574e2.html

CSL has many staff and other resources that will be needed for mRNA production. 

Have you thought about any way to involve them in working together with some new CDMO whose leadership is not "faint of heart" and that does not stand to have its recent $800 millon investment in 1980s vaccine technology joining its 1940s egg product business as a stranded asset resulting from mRNA flu vaccines?

Q11 Could a "Pharmaceutical Emergency Reserve" be established in support of the State Emergency Service or based on emergency vaccine manufacture as an Essential Service? Could legislative provisions similar to those that enable people with skills needed by the armed forces to be enrolled as Reserves for mobilization when needed while preserving their normal employment make it easier to recruit CSL staff for a new CDMO?

Q12 Are you confident that no emergency measures will be needed to accelerate mRNA manufacture for a sterilizing vaccine in the present pandemic as a result of the further evolution of some Variant Of Concern into a Variant of High Consequence that is both more infectious to people already vaccinated against earlier variants and more virulent especially against the majority of the world's population that remain unvaccinated but also against people infected despite vaccination?
